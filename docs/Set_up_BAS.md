# Getting Started

Welcome to this onboarding guide for developing applications on SAP BTP via BAS. The ultimate goal here is to build and deploy a full-stack application.
For that, it is necessary  to have a subaccount in SAP BTP to be able to subscribe to SAP Business Application Studio.

## Launch SAP Business Application Studio

1. When you are in the SAP Buisness Technology Platform Cockpit, navigate to **Instances and Subscriptions**.
2. Choose **SAP Business Application Studio** from the applications and choose **Go to Application**
3. Choose **Create Dev Space** (*Tipp:* create a bookmark to this page to easily get back to SAP BAS later.)
4. Choose a **Dev Space Name** (e.g. `IncidentsManagement`).
5. Choose template **Full stack Cloud Application** and choose **Create Dev Space**

> **Info**
> Now your dev space will be created. This can take some minutes.
