# Prerequisites

You have built your CAP application. See [Build a CAP application](Build_a_CAP_Application.md).

# Overview

SAP Fiori elements provides designs for UI patterns and predefined floorplans for common 
application use cases. App developers can use SAP Fiori elements to create SAP Fiori 
applications based on OData services and annotations that don't need JavaScript UI coding. 
The resulting app uses predefined views and controllers that are provided centrally. 
This means no application-specific view instances are required. SAPUI5 interprets metadata 
and annotations of the underlying OData service and uses the corresponding views for the SAP Fiori app at startup.

# Generate the UI with an SAP Fiori Elements Template

1. In SAP Business Application Studio, invoke the Command Palette
(**View** &rarr; **Command Palette** or `Shift + Command + P` for macOS / `Ctrl + Shift + P for Windows`) and choose **Fiori: Open Application Generator**.

2. Choose Template Type **SAP Fiori** and template **List Report Page**.
