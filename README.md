# Building an application with CAP using BAS

This is an onboarding guide is a tutorial based on the Incident management Sample Application.
the complete Guide through this tutorial can be found [here](./docs/Table_of_Contents.md).

besides that, this repository provides the sample application after following the Guide. It contains these folders and files:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration

However, we strongly recommend to follow our [Onboarding Guide](./docs/Table_of_Contents.md) along with the [CAP Documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) to experience the procedure of building an application yourself.
